      "options": [
          "A. All reflections are received from each pulse after the next pulse is sent.",
          "B. The distance to the reflecting object is inversely proportional to the round-trip travel time.",

      ],
      "answer": "C. The sound emitted by the transducer travels in straight lines.",
      "explanation": "Echocardiography is a diagnostic ultrasound test used to evaluate cardiac anatomy and physiology. As such, it is based on the physical principles of sound which travels through a medium in the form of a propagating wave. There are several assumptions behind the concept of ultrasound imaging that apply to echocardiography, and the violation of any of these can result in an artifact. Artifacts are images that are not real; located in the wrong place; have an inappropriate brightness, shape, or size; or represent structures that are missing.. Basic assumptions of ultrasound include the following: The ultrasonic wave emitted by the ultrasound probe travels along a straight line path to and from the transducer and makes only one path forward and back. All the echoes that are detected along that straight line originate from the axis of the main beam only. All reflections are received from each pulse before the next pulse is sent. Sound travels in tissue at a speed of 1540 m/sec. The distance to the reflecting object is determined by the elapsed time between the transmitted pulse and the detected echo. This distance is proportional to the round-trip travel time. The amplitude of returning echoes is related directly to the reflecting or scattering properties of distant objects.       ",

              "explanation": "Mirror-image artifacts are produced when a structure is located in front of a strong reflector, or highly reflective surface, causing a near total reflection of the ultrasound beam. The transducer assumes a single reflection from the strong reflector to the transducer, though on its path back to the transducer, the ultrasound is instead reflected back again to the strong reflector and then finally back to the transducer. Given this delay in time to return to the transducer, the image is assumed to be similar but at a greater depth. Refraction is produced by deflection of the ultrasound beam from its expected straight line, as it crosses the interface between two media with different propagation velocities. When structures located outside the main ultrasound beam are interrogated, a side lobe type of artifact can develop, as explained previously."

              "explanation": "Ring-down artifact is caused when a central fluid collection is trapped by a ring of air bubbles. The pocket of fluid and air continuously resonates reflecting back ultrasound and creating a region of a bright reflector. Posterior to this bright reflector of vibrating fluid and air is a linear beam of ultrasound referred to as a ring-down artifact. This is different from a comet tail artifact that is caused by reverberation of bright reflectors. Ring-down artifact is most common in any organ where there are air bubbles and water, such as the gastrointestinal system, but may be seen in cardiac imaging."

It is created from high-amplitude reflections from the transducer and affects the near field of the ultrasound beam. The appearance of additional echoes in the near field can mask weaker echoes of true anatomic structures or mimic a mass or thrombus. It is often misinterpreted as a left ventricular thrombus.

This can be seen in patients with mechanical valve prosthesis such as the one shown in Video 2-1, pacemaker wires, and other intracardiac devices. The video also shows significant reverberations caused by a mechanical valve that can cause a shadowing effect potentially obscuring the presence of valvular regurgitation. When this type of artifact appears, an alternate acoustic window is needed for evaluation of the area that lies behind the strongly reflecting object. In the case presented, a subcostal view could provide a better visualization of the left atrium. Reverberations or multiple reflections from an interface can make an artifact appear in the far field of the image. These reflections between the interface and the transducer create linear artifacts that do not correspond to anatomic structures"
