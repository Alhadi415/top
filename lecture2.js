    "question": "Which of the following fundamental principles of echocardiography is assumed to be correct when interpreting an ultrasound image?",
    "options": [
        "A. All reflections are received from each pulse after the next pulse is sent.",
        "B. The distance to the reflecting object is inversely proportional to the round-trip travel time.",
        "C. The sound emitted by the transducer travels in straight lines.",
        "D. Sound travels in tissue at a speed of 900 m/sec."
    ],
    "answer": "C. The sound emitted by the transducer travels in straight lines.",
    "explanation": "Echocardiography is a diagnostic ultrasound test used to evaluate cardiac anatomy and physiology. As such, it is based on the physical principles of sound which travels through a medium in the form of a propagating wave. There are several assumptions behind the concept of ultrasound imaging that apply to echocardiography, and the violation of any of these can result in an artifact. Artifacts are images that are not real; located in the wrong place; have an inappropriate brightness, shape, or size; or represent structures that are missing.. Basic assumptions of ultrasound include the following: The ultrasonic wave emitted by the ultrasound probe travels along a straight line path to and from the transducer and makes only one path forward and back. All the echoes that are detected along that straight line originate from the axis of the main beam only. All reflections are received from each pulse before the next pulse is sent. Sound travels in tissue at a speed of 1540 m/sec. The distance to the reflecting object is determined by the elapsed time between the transmitted pulse and the detected echo. This distance is proportional to the round-trip travel time. The amplitude of returning echoes is related directly to the reflecting or scattering properties of distant objects.       ",

    "question": "Linear artifacts within the ascending aorta:",
    "options": [
        "A. Produce interruption of the pattern of blood in the ascending aorta when color Doppler imaging is applied.",
        "B. May extend through the aortic wall.",
        "C. Display rapid oscillatory movement.",
        "D. Usually have clearly defined borders."

    "options": [
        "A. Linear artifacts within the ascending aorta are most commonly caused by ultrasound refraction.",
        "B. Artifacts are more likely to appear when the aortic diameter is smaller than the left atrial diameter.",
        "C. A linear structure located at half the distance from the transducer as from the anterior aortic wall is most likely an artifact.",
        "D. M-mode echocardiography has proven to be useful in distinguishing artifacts from true aortic flaps."

    "answer": "D. M-mode echocardiography has proven to be useful in distinguishing artifacts from true aortic flaps.",

    "question": "Which of the following statements regarding reverberation-type artifacts is correct?",
    "options": [
        "A. Multiple path artifacts are the result of reverberations between weakly reflective surfaces.",
        "B. The larger the impedance mismatch between media, the higher the likelihood of reflections to occur.",
        "C. Interfaces oriented parallel to the direction of sound propagation have the highest probability of creating reflections.",
        "D. The intensity of the reverberation lines increases as the distance from the transducer increases.",
        "E. Reverberations cannot be eliminated from the field of view."
    ],
    "answer": "C. Interfaces oriented parallel to the direction of sound propagation have the highest probability of creating reflections.",
    "explanation": "Reverberation occurs when sound waves reflect multiple times between parallel surfaces, creating artifacts on the ultrasound image.",
